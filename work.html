                    This application was developed as the backend part of a movies library application. An API was
                    created to
                    allow users of the app to have access to the database of movies. Any user can create an account and
                    then login. Once a user is logged in, he/she receives a JWT token which allows him/ her to make
                    queries to the database. These queries will provide information about the movies (genre,
                    directors, etc.). The users of the app can create a list of their favourite movies, where they can
                    add
                    and delete movies. Finally a user can also delete his/ her profile.

                <p>myFlix is a movie library, full-stack web application built with the MERN stack. The
                    app allows users once registered and logged in to view the list of movies present in
                    the database, create a list of their favourite movies and view information about the
                    different directors and genres. Finally users can also decide to deregister from the
                    application.</p>

                <h3 class="headers">Purpose and Context</h3>
                <p>The project was part of my careerfoundry web development bootcamp. The aim was to
                    demonstrate my ability to create a full stack application using JavaScript
                    programming language. Also, myFlix application was the perfect project for myself
                    because of my passion for movies. Therefore I was very enthusiastic to develop the
                    app and showcase it to fellow developers and film enthusiasts.</p>
                <h3 class="headers">Objective</h3>
                <p>The objective of the project was to build a full-stack application from scratch using
                    the
                    MERN stack to showcase my skills to potential employers. The project started by
                    building
                    the database and back-end of the application with the use of MongoDB, Node.js and
                    Express. The client-side on the other hand was developed using React.js. </p>

                <h2 class="approach-header">Approach</h2>
                <h3 class="headers">Back-end</h3>
                <p>First, I used Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API that would interact with
                    the
                    movies database, which was created using a non-relational database (MongoDB). The
                    database contains two collections: movies, which contains all movies and their
                    relative
                    information (synopsis, genre and director); users, which contains the list of all
                    registered users and their personal information.</p>
                <p>The API can be accessed via HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE). In order to
                    interact
                    with the database and be able to store and retrieve data, I made use of CRUD methods
                    (mainly using Create, Read, Update, and Delete). Finally the data returned from the
                    database is in a JSON format.</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="./img/Postman-Screenshot.png" class="postman__portrait" alt="postman screenshot"
                        width="60%" height="60%">
                    <p>To test the application in the development phase, I used Postman. For authentication
                        and
                        authorization, I used HTTP and JWT tokens. The API was then hosted on Heroku.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="headers">Front-end</h3>

                <p>Regarding the front-end of the application, it is a single page application built
                    with React.js. The application provides the user with several views that include a
                    login view, a registration view, a main view (displays all movies in the database),
                    a movie view (displays information about a single movie), a genre view (displays
                    information about a specific genre), a director view (displays information about a
                    specific director) and a profile view (displays personal information about the
                    logged in user, that can also be updated).</p>
                <img src="./img/Profile-Screenshot.png" class="profile_portrait" alt="MyFlix-App screenshot" width="60%"
                    height="30%">
                <h3 class="headers">Challenges</h3>
                <p>This was definitely one of my favourite projects and most challenging too. Before
                    working on this project, I had not worked on projects involving building the
                    back-end of an application, so it was very rewarding building my own API and
                    database at the same time. Also I got pretty good at using the terminal.</p>
                <p>In regards to the front-end, it was my first time working with React and to be honest
                    it took me a while to comprehend how the state and props of a component function and
                    how to manipulate them, but thankfully after getting some practice and watching some
                    useful tutorials online, I managed to complete the app successfully.</p>
                <h3 class="headers">Duration</h3>
                <p>It took a little over two month to complete the entire application.</p>
